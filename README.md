This repository is made up of my personal projects I have done within Excel related with Data.

This first image is a screenshot from a Pivot Table I did in Excel for Spotify's Top 10 Artist with the Most Streams in 2023.
Before making the Pivot Table I had to get the data analyzed. Which included cleaning the data by formatting a lot of the data with doing research and
changing the names of mispelled artists and their songs, and then I had to ensure that the data was formatted the correct way, such as changing the format values
for the numbers on the streamed songs. Then I had to create a sum value of the individual songs together for each artist. Checked for blank cells and duplicated
values just in case, but thankfully didn't have any. Afterwards I was able to create a Pivot Table with the information and turn it into the bar chart you see below.
