# Excel_Projects
This repository is made up of my personal projects I have done within Excel related with Data.

This first image is a screenshot from a Pivot Table I did in Excel for Spotify's Top 10 Artist with the Most Streams in 2023.
Before making the Pivot Table I had to get the data analyzed. Which included cleaning the data by formatting a lot of the data with doing research and
changing the names of mispelled artists and their songs, and then I had to ensure that the data was formatted the correct way, such as changing the format values
for the numbers on the streamed songs. Then I had to create a sum value of the individual songs together for each artist. Checked for blank cells and duplicated
values just in case, but thankfully didn't have any. Afterwards I was able to create a Pivot Table with the information and turn it into the bar chart you see below.

With this dashboard on Bike Sales, I was able to use the data and model it into different graphs and slicers within the dashboard. The graphs show the Avg income
Per Purchase based on if the bike was purchased or not, and by each gender. Shows Customer Age Brackets from Adolescent to Old and how many bikes were purchased. And lastly,
 the Customer Commute graph shows the average commute ranging from 0-1 miles to 10 miles+. You can also use the slicers on the side to filter the data by Marital Status,
 Region, and even Education.

This dashboard was used to show details in each country, sales of each type of coffee, the types of coffee, and much more. This project implemented more of XLOOKUP and TRIM and PROPER than any other Excel shortcuts. And allowed for more practice on creation of Pivot Tables and how to properly display data into a dashboard.

This dashboard is simple but efficient. It shows the Customer Churn rate for a Telecomm company based off of it's contracts: Month-to-Month, One Year, Two Year. Shows which percentage of each contract has a customer churn, has the average cost of each contract, and how many customers are with each contract. This is very beneficial for any company as to find out why customers are leaving or staying.

This image shows different KPI metrics for 1000 freelancers, such as the language for each freelancer, the hourly pay rate for each freelancer, and much more.
